## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

EduBot is powered by Flask on the backend. When a user submits a message, the bot interprets their intent and searches `career_data.json` for relevant information. It then constructs and sends an appropriate response, simulating a helpful conversation.

- [ ] Enable multi-turn conversation flow
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (Heroku, Render, etc.) for public access
- [ ] Expand dataset with rich, real-world guidance
- [ ] Add external API integrations (e.g., job market trends, course recommendations)
